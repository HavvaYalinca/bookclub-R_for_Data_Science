## Dates and times in R

Dates and times come in many different formats.

* DMY: e.g. "31.1.17", "31/01/2017"
* MDY: e.g. "January 31st, 2017"
* YMD: e.g. "2017-01-31"

## Sources of dates and times


### 1. From a string.
#### Dates
```{r}
ymd("2017-01-31") # or ymd(20170131)
mdy("January 31st, 2017")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")
```


---

## Sources of dates and times in R


### 1. From a string
#### Times

```{r}
ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
mdy_hm("01/31/2017 08:01")
ymd(20170131, tz = "UTC")
```

---

### 2. From individual components - using `make_date()`

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>%
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, 
                                   day, hour, minute))

```


---

### 3. From an existing date/time object

You can switch between dates and date-times.

```{r}
as_datetime(today())

as_date(now())

```

Converting a Unix Epoch to date or datetime.

```{r}
as_datetime(60 * 60 * 10)
as_date(365 * 10 + 2)
```

---

## Date-time components - as integers

You can extract a date or time component from a datetime object.
```{r, eval=T}
datetime <- ymd_hms("2020-11-02 12:34:56")

year(datetime)
month(datetime)
mday(datetime)

wday(datetime)
```

---

## Date-time components - as strings

You can extract a named day or month from a datetime object.
```{r}
month(datetime, label = TRUE)
wday(datetime, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

---

## Rounding to the nearest component

You can round a date or datetime object to the nearest component, such as month. Similar to rounding floats, `round`, `ceiling` and `floor` options exist (followed by `_date` suffix for dates and datetimes.

```{r}
floor_date(ymd(20201102), "month")
ceiling_date(ymd(20201102), "month")
round_date(ymd(20201102), "month") # down
round_date(ymd(20201122), "month") # up
```

---

## Setting individual components

You can also change an individual component of a date or datetime object.

```{r}
(datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56"))

year(datetime) <- 2020
datetime
month(datetime) <- 01
datetime
hour(datetime) <- hour(datetime) + 1
datetime
```

---

## Updating dates and datetimes

Another way of creating or updating a date or datetime is by using the `update()` function.

```{r}
update(datetime, year = 2020, month = 2, mday = 2, hour = 2)

#If values are too big, they will roll-over
ymd("2015-02-01") %>% 
  update(mday = 30) #
ymd("2015-02-01") %>% 
  update(hour = 400)
```


---

## Time spans

The `lubridate` package also allows us to do arithmetic with dates and datetimes.

--

There are 3 main classes of time spans supported by lubridate:
* durations: which represent an exact number of seconds.
* periods, which represent human units like weeks and months.
* intervals, which represent a starting and ending point.
 
```{r}
# How old is Hadley?
h_age <- today() - ymd(19791014)
h_age

as.duration(h_age)
```

---

## Duration constructors

There are constructors for converting from other components into durations.

Caution: These functions use standard lengths - they don't take leap years and daylight saving time changes into account.

```{r, eval=F}
dseconds(15)
#> [1] "15s"
dminutes(10)
#> [1] "600s (~10 minutes)"
dhours(c(12, 24))
#> [1] "43200s (~12 hours)" "86400s (~1 days)"
ddays(0:5)
#> [1] "0s"                "86400s (~1 days)"  "172800s (~2 days)"
#> [4] "259200s (~3 days)" "345600s (~4 days)" "432000s (~5 days)"
dweeks(3)
#> [1] "1814400s (~3 weeks)"
dyears(1)
#> [1] "31557600s (~1 years)"
```

---

## Duration arithmetic

```{r}
2 * dyears(1)
dyears(1) + dweeks(12) + dhours(15)

(tomorrow <- today() + ddays(1))
(last_year <- today() - dyears(1))
```

---

## Periods
Periods are time spans but don’t have a fixed length in seconds, instead they work with “human” times, like days and months.

```{r}
one_pm <- ymd_hms("2016-03-12 13:00:00")
one_pm + days(1)
```

---

## Period constructors

Periods can be constructed in a similar way to durations.
```{r, eval=F}
seconds(15)
#> [1] "15S"
minutes(10)
#> [1] "10M 0S"
hours(c(12, 24))
#> [1] "12H 0M 0S" "24H 0M 0S"
days(7)
#> [1] "7d 0H 0M 0S"
months(1:6)
#> [1] "1m 0d 0H 0M 0S" "2m 0d 0H 0M 0S" "3m 0d 0H 0M 0S" "4m 0d 0H 0M 0S"
#> [5] "5m 0d 0H 0M 0S" "6m 0d 0H 0M 0S"
weeks(3)
#> [1] "21d 0H 0M 0S"
years(1)
#> [1] "1y 0m 0d 0H 0M 0S"
```


---

## Period arithmetic - 1

Periods can be added and multiplied as well as being added to dates, like durations.
```{r, eval=F}
10 * (months(6) + days(1))
#> [1] "60m 10d 0H 0M 0S"
days(50) + hours(25) + minutes(2)
#> [1] "50d 25H 2M 0S"

```


---

## Period arithmetic - 2

Periods obey rules about time zones and daylight saving time.

```{r, eval=F}
# A leap year
ymd("2016-01-01") + dyears(1)
#> [1] "2016-12-31 06:00:00 UTC"
ymd("2016-01-01") + years(1)
#> [1] "2017-01-01"

# Daylight Savings Time
one_pm + ddays(1)
#> [1] "2016-03-13 14:00:00 EDT"
one_pm + days(1)
#> [1] "2016-03-13 13:00:00 EDT"
```


---

## Intervals

An interval is a duration with a starting point: that makes it precise so you can determine exactly how long it is.
```{r}
next_year <- today() + years(1)
(today() %--% next_year) / ddays(1)

# To find out how many periods fall into an interval, 
#  you need to use integer division:

(today() %--% next_year) %/% days(1)
```



---

## Summary of arithmetic with datetime classes

> How do you pick between duration, periods, and intervals? As always, pick the simplest data structure that solves your problem. If you only care about physical time, use a duration; if you need to add human times, use a period; if you need to figure out how long a span is in human units, use an interval.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0020136325ea844476bc61eb7e95d2ac5aeebf00/893e9/diagrams/datetimes-arithmetic.png")
